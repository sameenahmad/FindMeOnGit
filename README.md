# Github-Directory

Here I have created a Github User directory which fetches user details on the basis of the username entered by the User. It showes them the details like Number of repos they own, Followers, Following etc. 
I have used Github users API to fetch user data and ES6 async await in place of promises!
The main purpose of this project is to learn Error handling while developing a Web-Application. It takes care of all kinds of error that may cause the application to crash.
