# FindMeOnGit

Here I have created a Github User directory which fetches user details on the basis of the username entered by the User. 

It shows them the details like Number of repos they own, Followers, Following, and other meta data.

I have used Github users API to fetch user data and ES6 async await in place of promises! (I _promise_ they rock!)

The main purpose of this project is to learn Error handling while developing a WebApp. 

It takes care of all the errors that might arise in case the API call fails, or if the returned data is malformed.
